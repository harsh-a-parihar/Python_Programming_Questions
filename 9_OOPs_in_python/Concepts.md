# Object Oriented Programming(OOPs).
------------------------------------

**OOPs in Python revolves around creating "objects" that contain both data (attributes) and functions (methods) to operate on the data, enabling code organization and reusability through concepts like classes and inheritance.**

## Resource to learn

1. Go through the given link from [here](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_object_oriented_programming.asp), where you will learn about OOPs concepts like `Classes`, `Objects`, `Inheritance`, `Polymorphism`, `Encapsulation`, `Abstraction` and `File Handling` in Python.
2. You can also visit the below sub-chapters of `chapter.9` of this **Python Docs** to learn about OOPs concepts in Python.
    - [Chapter.8.1](https://bsc-iitm.github.io/python-textbook/chapter-8/lesson-8.1/)
    - [Chapter.8.2](https://bsc-iitm.github.io/python-textbook/chapter-8/lesson-8.2/)
    - [Chapter.8.3](https://bsc-iitm.github.io/python-textbook/chapter-8/lesson-8.3/)
