# Dicsonary and Sets.
---------------------

**Dictionaries in Python are unordered collections of key-value pairs, allowing efficient retrieval and storage of data. They are defined using curly braces {key:Value}. And, Sets in Python are unordered and contain unique elements, making them useful for mathematical operations like union and intersection. They are defined using curly braces {element,}.**

## Resource to learn

1. Go through the below sub-chapters of `chapter.6` of this **Python Docs**, where you will learn about Dictionaries and Sets and there operations/uses. Try to solve as much questions as you can.
    - [Chapter.6.1](https://bsc-iitm.github.io/python-textbook/chapter-6/lesson-6.1/)
