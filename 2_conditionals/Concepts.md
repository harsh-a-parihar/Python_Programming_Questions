# Conditional Statements.
-------------------------

**This section deals with the concept of Conditional Statements which means, you define appropriate conditions for which a certain task should be performed. Here you'll learn about if, if-else, if-elif-else, nested conditionals, libraries, etc.**

## Resource to learn

1. To dive in the topic Conditional Statements, go through the sub-chapter [Chapter .2.3](https://bsc-iitm.github.io/python-textbook/chapter-2/lesson-2.3/) of `chapter.2` of this **Python Docs**. I would encourage you to go through below sub-chapter before jumping to conditional statements.
    - [Chapter.2.1](https://bsc-iitm.github.io/python-textbook/chapter-2/lesson-2.1/)
        - here you'll learn about; Assignment Operators & assignment, keywords, etc.
    - [Chapter.2.2](https://bsc-iitm.github.io/python-textbook/chapter-2/lesson-2.2/)
        - here you'll learn about; Input, Type-convertion, and Built-in functions.
2. After learning about above chapters, go through the last sub-chapters [Chapter.2.4](https://bsc-iitm.github.io/python-textbook/chapter-2/lesson-2.4/) of `chapter.1`, in which you'll learn about Library and some of the famous libraries in python.
3. You can also learn these concepts from [Python Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp) of **W3Schools**.
