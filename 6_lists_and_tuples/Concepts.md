# Lists and Tuples.
-------------------

**Lists in Python are ordered, mutable collections of items. They can contain elements of different data types and are defined using square brackets `[]`. On the otherhand, Tuples are similar to lists but are immutable, meaning their elements cannot be changed after creation. They are defined using parentheses `()`.**

## Resource to learn

1. Go through the below sub-chapters of `chapter.5` of this **Python Docs**, where you'll be more about lists and tuples and there operations/uses. **NOTE:**  We have already used lists and tuples in the `Practice_Questions` of previous lessons, so you might be familiar with them. If not, then go through the below sub-chapters and practice those previous questions too.
    - [Chapter.5.1](https://bsc-iitm.github.io/python-textbook/chapter-5/lesson-5.1/)
    - [Chapter.5.2](https://bsc-iitm.github.io/python-textbook/chapter-5/lesson-5.2/)
    - [Chapter.5.3](https://bsc-iitm.github.io/python-textbook/chapter-5/lesson-5.3/)
    - [Chapter.5.4](https://bsc-iitm.github.io/python-textbook/chapter-5/lesson-5.4/)
    - [Chapter.5.5](https://bsc-iitm.github.io/python-textbook/chapter-5/lesson-5.5/)
    - [Chapter.5.6](https://bsc-iitm.github.io/python-textbook/chapter-5/lesson-5.6/)
