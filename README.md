## üß† Getting Started

### **Prerequisites and Installations**
----


To leverage this repository effectively, ensure you have:

1. **Python** installed (`version 3.12.0` and above), you can [download](https://www.python.org/downloads/) from here.

2. **VS Code** installed, [download](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) from here. You can use any code editor that fits you better.

3. **VS Code Extensions** installed, there are some useful extensions like, Pylance, Python, etc. which are helpful.

4. **NOTE :** If you can't use code editor on your laptop due to any reason, You can use online Code Editors like:
    - [Replite](https://replit.com/)
    - [CodePen](https://codepen.io/) (generally for developers)


### **Practice Guidelines**
----

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/python-learning-repo.git

2. **Understand each topic:** Read the questions and then answer code of all the topics and try to understand it.
    - **NOTE :** If you stuck somewhere, you can refer to the `Concepts.md` file of that topic/session.

3. **Python Docs:** You can refer to this [Python Textbook](https://bsc-iitm.github.io/python-textbook/) for one time, it will help you to understand the concepts in one go.

4. **Practice and iterate:** Now, practice by writing your own code. It could be similar, but what matters is only that you got it. If you stuck, revisite the question and find out where are you wrong and fix it. Iterate the processes unless you feel comfortable.

5. **Search:** It's the very basic thing you must know. If, you stuck somewhere very badly, just google it! stackoverflow it!
